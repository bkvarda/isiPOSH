# isiPOSH
isiPOSH is a repository that includes some basic PowerShell scripts to interact with Isilon. Some examples include getting shares, creating shares, and deleting shares.

To create this scripts I have leveraged previous work from Brandon Kvarda (https://github.com/bkvarda) on Powershell and XtremIO and looked at an example from Jeremy Smith (ps_isilon_get_quotas_via_papi.ps1) on how to get quotas from an Isilon with PowerShell. 
By combining these two sources of examples, I have created some scripts that use PowerShell to work with Isilon shares.
